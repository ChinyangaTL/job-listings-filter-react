# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering solution

So I spent the afternoon learning Tailwind. Figured I might as well put it to use with my newly acquired react skills.

This is a solution to the [Job listings with filtering challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
